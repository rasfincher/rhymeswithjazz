            This is the first post on my newest blog. I tend to create a new
            blog every couple of years and go through a cycle of being extremely
            excited about it, then only occasionaly posting, and then dormancy.
            I make no claims that this time will be any different. What is
            different this time is that I'm not using any sort of blogging
            engine to create this blog. No
            <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, no Drupal, no Jekyll,
            no Hugo. Just plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What I hope to
            gain out of this is a chance to evaluate the things I need and the
            things I want. When I run across a problem that was easily solved
            with a blogging engine I'm going to have to either write my own
            solution, or decide I didn't really need it that much anyway. It's
            an experiment!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was inspired by
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225180834/https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/"
              >Rediscovering the Small Web</a
            >, an essay celebrating
            <span class="blink">the good old days</span> of the internet. I'll
            be turning 41 in a few months, and I'm going through a reminiscent
            phase. I'm not going full "get off my lawn", but I do miss the days
            where it was simple to follow exactly what was going on on the web.
            Don't get me wrong, a ton of my day-to-day work is with frameworks
            like Angular and ASP.net, but there is something satisfying about
            the speed and simplicity of a website written in boring technology.
          </p>

            So back to the title. Is simple better? I guess I'll find out. I
            look forward to updating this site with my experiences, good and
            bad. And maybe I'll even stick with this for longer than a month or
            two!
